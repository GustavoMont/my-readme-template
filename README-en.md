## About it

This is a project developed with Pyhon that  automate the creation of README.md files for my projects. I developed this project 'cause I need to standardize my README files, and so that I could save time to translate the information from these files. Usually I write the README file in Portuguese and then I write another one in English, so automating this creation saves me time as the two files are done simultaneously.
